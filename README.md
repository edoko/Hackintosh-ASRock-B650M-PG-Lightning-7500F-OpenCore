## Working
- USB Ports

- Ethernet
- DRM Contents
- iCloud
- Sleep/Wake


## Not tested
- On-board audio
  - I'm currently using the USB to get sound in/out, so I'll be testing onboard audio soon.
- AirDrop, Continuity
  - Similarly, I don't have a Wi-Fi/BT device, so I can't test it.


## Known issues
- Wi-Fi/BT
  - I didn't have that device on my motherboard, so I couldn't test it. If you do, you'll need to do some extra work.
- Shutdown and reboot
  - Currently, when you shutdown macOS, it starts rebooting immediately. This will be fixed soon.
